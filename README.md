# The Idea in a nutshell

Cyberpunk x Tamagotchi.

Make it look and feel Cyberpunk, so we need to add some 3D Stuff! :)
Make the "gameplay" simple yet diverse.
Make it easy to extend.


## Roadmap
- Get a proper codebase going
- Implement actual (core)gameplay with mostly placeholder designs
- Refactor time probably
- Make 3D Models
   - Either N-DS/PS1 Style 
   - Or proper Models (polycount ala PS2/3)
      - with baked normal maps
      - PBR textures (all stylized)
- Implement the 3D Stuff
- Design a proper UI and UX
   - Design the Page to "feel" Cyberpunk and make it immersive
   - Menu madness probably
- Refactor & Extend Gameplay/Systems
